# MatheCSharp
This is a program to manage functions. It can create linear and exponential functions through two given points. Afterwards you can have it calculate value tables and check if a specified point lies on the function's graph.

This is a port from its original java version: https://github.com/willigross/mathe

This program uses "Fast Lightweight Expression Evaluator" by Ciloci: https://flee.codeplex.com/
and "Costura" by Fody: https://github.com/Fody/Costura
